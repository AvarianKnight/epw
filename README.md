# Entity Pickup Whitelist

Entity Pickup Whitelist is a little addon I made in order to be able to pickup entities in DarkRP. I was tired of every entity having to be gravity gunned in order to move them, so I made this nice little system.

## Installation

Download the ZIP and extract the files into your addon folder.
